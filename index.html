      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <h4> Aspiring Woman in Engineering. </br> </br> Computer Science Student. </br> </br> Career Changer. </h4>
        <p> Graduating the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a B.A. in Psychology and Legal Studies, I had my heart and mind set on law school. I studied logic games and logical reasoning questions for months in order to take on the infamous LSAT. The hard work paid off and I was ultimately acceted to Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University. Half way through the semester I began doing something I should have done a long time ago - asking myself what I want out of my career and my life. After much thought about my interests, values, and goals (and after many pro/con lists) I found that law school was not the right step for me at this time in my life. So I left law school after one semester and co-founded a non-profit whose aim is to increase technology access and exposure in rural areas. After law school, I worked as an immigration paralegal. During this time, I began teaching myself to code on the side and discovered an interest in the technology field ranging from cyber security to human-computer interaction. Stemming from a legal background, I am skilled in project management, persuasive writing, critical thinking, research, and process improvements. I am self-starter with a self-taught background in front-end web development using HTML and CSS and who is looking to continually grow as a professional and as an individual with a specific interest in the intersection of psychology and technology.

      <h2> <img src= "heart.svg" /> Favorites </h2>
      <p> Staying active and getting outside is key for me. I enjoy hiking, camping, kayaking, walking, swimming, and sprint triathalons. My boyfriend and I are currently embarking on a journey to build a camper van out of our Chevy Astro and I cannot wait to get started. I have a fear of heights which makes some hikes a bit challenging for me, but I always try to push through. I enjoy expressing my artistic side through cooking, writing, and web development. Movie nights, reading a good book, and Badger Games are all beloved pastimes. One day, I hope to become a dog-mom to an adopted yorkie. There is very little I love doing more than learning new things.
